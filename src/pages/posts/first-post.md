Hey! As you've most likely gathered by now my name is Josh, great to meet you.

I am a recently graduted software engineer and am completely new to technical writing. These blogs will be a mixture of things I find interesting, things I learn and things I built mainly.

Hoping to write some interesting pieces over the next few months to help with my constant improvement and interests within software developement.
