# Learning On The Go

This blog post will be a, hopefully, interesting view and study in to how the technical space has evolved to be able to study and work on the go. As I begin to write this article I am at an altitude of 35990 feet and going a ground speed of 616mph from London Heathrow to LAX. I can take out my Macbook and code with nearly all the tools you have available to you on the ground and begin to code or study.

I have done some work on my personal site that you are currently visiting and that sparked the idea for the blog post as I was over due to get a new piece of writing. It's not clear what this article may be yet but I will start with things I think are necessary for working/studying on the go.

- **A Device.** I think this is the most obvious of all of the list. Although not completely necessary as you could write code with pen and paper, lets work off the assumption that 99% of people will be using a laptop or an iPad. The laptop can be your choice but I have found the most popular for software developers or those in the creative spaces is a MacBook. I personally am using a MacBook and I love it. I am still getting used to it's features but I am enjoying the process of learning. Alongside this, please remember a charger otherwise you may have all the tools to study and run out of power.
- **A Task.** I think potentially equally as important or can be argued as important is a task or a subject to focus on. Otherwise you have the time and the resources but no real goal. Have you been meaning to read about that new framework or library? Have you always wanted to know what is it _exactly_ that DevOps engineers do? You now have the time to do so if you would like.
- **A Book.** This doesn't have to be a necessity but I think with no internet access a book to learn from or makes notes from would be really beneficial here. If you are learning a new language or framework you could work through a book of exercises or have it for referance. I am debating this myself for the return journey of my honeymoon if I can find a cool book somewhere.
- **Headphones.** A tool that all those working on the go will always benefit from. Headphones have become as much a staple for workers as the device they work on. Whether it be to block out background noise or take a work call you will always benefit from having your headphones packed. Also remember and download your favourite playlist or podcast for the flight!
- **Notebook, Pen and Paper.** These are more items that I feel may not be necessary everytime but I always like to have. It may be you want to make notes to yourself of something you learned or discovered about your project, it may be to take a note to review and research something later down the line but I feel they are worth having in your backpack at all times.
- **Food and Water.** This item on the list is certainly a must for me. Load up on water (or coffee) and snacks for those long haul flights. Nothing worse than a rumbling stomach to break your flow. It is so important to keep hydrated to keep your brain activated and as healthy as you can
