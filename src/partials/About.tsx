    <br></br>
    <p>
      As mentioned previously mentioned my name is Josh! I am a recent graduate
      of Web and Mobile Development from the University West of Scotland. As you
      can see from my work experience I haven't always worked in tech but I was
      always determined to work in the industry I was most interested in.{' '}
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
      Once I went back to education I found a love for learning that I put in to
      practise everyday. Rarely a day passes where I'm not learning a language -
      Scottish Gaelic or coding - or reading and soaking up other material
      including coding practises and history or poetry (mainly Robery Burns). I
      feel my love of reading and learning is a perfect for my career in
      software development. As I enjoy writing blog posts this is a great way to
      learn new material and write about my progress.<br></br>
      <br></br>
      Please see below my work experiences across all industries I have worked
      in. If you have any questions please get in touch!
